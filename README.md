# MatrixTransformer

This project allows users to manipulate randomly generated A and B matrices by swapping specific rows and columns. The main functionalities are as follows:

1. Generate two A and B matrices of size 5 x 5 filled with random numbers.
2. Fill the elements of the matrices with random values between 0 and 10.
3. Print the generated A and B matrices to the screen.
4. Prompt the user to input a row and column number, swapping the elements at the specified position in matrices A and B.
5. Print the new A and B matrices to the screen and calculate their product matrix C.
6. Prompt the user to continue the program or exit by generating new random matrices or displaying a "Goodbye" message.

This project is designed to practice matrix operations and provide users with an interactive experience.
