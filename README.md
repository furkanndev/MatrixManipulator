# Matrix Manipulator

This C++ project allows users to manipulate randomly generated matrices by swapping specific rows and columns. It provides an interactive terminal interface for users to perform various matrix operations.

## Features

- Generate two A and B matrices of size 5 x 5 filled with random numbers.
- Fill the elements of the matrices with random values between 0 and 10.
- Print the generated A and B matrices to the terminal.
- Prompt the user to input a row and column number, swapping the elements at the specified position in matrices A and B.
- Print the new A and B matrices to the terminal and calculate their product matrix C.
- Prompt the user to continue the program or exit by generating new random matrices or displaying a "Goodbye" message.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone <repository-url>


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd matrix-manipulator


3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler. For example, using g++:

g++ -o matrix_manipulator main.cpp


4. Run the compiled executable:

./matrix_manipulator


5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program. You can input row and column numbers to swap elements in matrices A and B, view the updated matrices, and choose to continue the program or exit.

## Requirements
